The **DIversity-driven Multi-view Ensemble IDS** (**DIME-IDS**) is introduced in the paper as a diversity-based, multi-view approach for improving intrusion detection in SCADA environments.  
It integrates **multi-objective feature optimization**, **ensemble diversity**, and **dynamic classifier selection** to enhance detection robustness, including against previously unseen attacks.
